# EC Failure Rate Project

This is the **EC Failure Rate Project**, a software tool designed to calculate the reliability and failure rates of electrical components based on **IEC 61709 standards**.

## Project Structure

- **BackEnd/**: Contains the backend implementation using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). It handles API requests, database operations, and provides endpoints for frontend integration.
- **FrontEnd/**: (Optional section if applicable) Contains the frontend implementation, possibly using Angular or another framework, to interact with the backend APIs.

## Features

- **API Integration**: Robust backend APIs to calculate and manage component failure rates.
- **Database Support**: Easily configurable database settings to store and retrieve data.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Accessible through `<span>/admin</span>` for managing backend models and settings.
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration using a `<span>.env</span>` file.
